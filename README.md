# BookLoanManagement
“Book Loan Management” is a web application. The main tasks of this application are managing books, authors, categories, publishers, customers and loans. In this application, we can mainly implement add, update, view, search and delete operations on those objects.
I build this project with Blazor and Asp.Net Core 5. For the web UIs, they are built with Blazor using C#. And, for the backend, I create REST Api and test api with postman. The database and all tables were created with Entity Framework Core and stored in SqlServer LocalDB.
